And I can move on from here
How simple: life goes on
Humble, that's how I feel
Sparking hot flames, holding on

Younger days run so clear
Through my mind, replaying my crime
Tearing me up, spreading fear
Obsession in my own time

What life's taken away, I'm not missing
Will I sit back and sigh?
A thunder of thoughts, I'm dismissing
Too scared to even try

And in time I've always known
I'm never in the safety zone
I took the fight, but was I right?
They were sending me to war

And in time I've always known
I'm never in the safety zone
I took the fight, but was I right?
They were sending me to war

My intention is strong and real
Only power steels my will
The illusion of safety's surreal
Don't let it go for the kill!
